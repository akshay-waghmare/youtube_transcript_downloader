# Feature Specification: yttranscript CLI Tool

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-youtube`  
**Created**: 2025-01-23  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a YouTube transcript downloader CLI tool named 'yttranscript' that accepts a YouTube video URL and extracts the transcript. The tool should support outputting transcripts in plain text and Markdown formats, handle multiple languages, provide clear progress indicators, and gracefully handle errors like unavailable transcripts, private videos, or network issues. The CLI should be simple to use with intuitive flags and helpful error messages"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Basic Transcript Extraction (Priority: P1)

A user provides a YouTube video URL and wants to extract the transcript to view or save it. The tool downloads the transcript and displays it in plain text format by default.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that delivers immediate value. Without this, the tool has no purpose. It represents the minimal viable product.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running `yttranscript https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID` and verifying transcript content is extracted and displayed correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a valid YouTube video URL with available transcript, **When** user runs `yttranscript URL`, **Then** the transcript is displayed in plain text format
2. **Given** a valid YouTube video URL, **When** user runs the command, **Then** progress indicators show download status
3. **Given** a YouTube video URL, **When** transcript extraction completes, **Then** the full transcript content is readable and properly formatted

### User Story 2 - Output Format Selection (Priority: P2)

A user wants to choose between plain text and Markdown output formats for the transcript, allowing them to use the output in different contexts (documentation, notes, etc.).

**Why this priority**: This adds immediate utility by making the output more versatile. Users can integrate the transcript into their existing workflows.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by running `yttranscript URL --format markdown` and verifying Markdown formatting is applied correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a YouTube video URL, **When** user runs `yttranscript URL --format plain`, **Then** transcript is output in plain text
2. **Given** a YouTube video URL, **When** user runs `yttranscript URL --format markdown`, **Then** transcript is output with Markdown formatting
3. **Given** no format specified, **When** user runs `yttranscript URL`, **Then** plain text format is used as default

---

### User Story 3 - File Output (Priority: P2)

A user wants to save the transcript to a file instead of displaying it on screen, allowing them to process or store the transcript for later use.

**Why this priority**: Essential for practical use cases where users need to save transcripts. Enables batch processing and integration with other tools.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running `yttranscript URL --output transcript.txt` and verifying the file contains the correct transcript content.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a YouTube video URL and output filename, **When** user runs `yttranscript URL --output filename.txt`, **Then** transcript is saved to the specified file
2. **Given** an output file that already exists, **When** user runs the command, **Then** user is prompted to confirm overwrite or use --force flag
3. **Given** an invalid file path, **When** user attempts to save, **Then** clear error message explains the issue

---

### User Story 4 - Multi-language Support (Priority: P3)

A user wants to extract transcripts from videos that have multiple language options available, allowing them to specify which language transcript to download.

**Why this priority**: Expands utility for international content but not essential for core functionality. Can be added after basic features are solid.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested with multilingual videos by running `yttranscript URL --language es` and verifying Spanish transcript is retrieved.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a video with multiple transcript languages, **When** user runs `yttranscript URL --language LANG_CODE`, **Then** transcript in specified language is extracted
2. **Given** a video with transcripts, **When** user runs `yttranscript URL --list-languages`, **Then** available languages are displayed
3. **Given** an unavailable language requested, **When** user specifies the language, **Then** fallback to default language with warning message

---

### User Story 5 - Robust Error Handling (Priority: P1)

A user encounters various error conditions (private videos, network issues, unavailable transcripts) and receives clear, actionable error messages that help them understand what went wrong.

**Why this priority**: Critical for user experience and tool reliability. Without proper error handling, users get frustrated and abandon the tool.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by providing invalid URLs, private video URLs, and videos without transcripts, verifying appropriate error messages.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an invalid YouTube URL, **When** user runs the command, **Then** clear error message explains URL format requirements
2. **Given** a private video URL, **When** user attempts extraction, **Then** specific error message indicates video is private/restricted
3. **Given** a video without transcripts, **When** user runs the command, **Then** clear message indicates no transcripts are available
4. **Given** network connectivity issues, **When** download fails, **Then** error message suggests retry and troubleshooting steps

### Edge Cases

- What happens when YouTube video URL contains tracking parameters or playlist information?
- How does system handle very long transcripts (e.g., 10+ hour videos)?
- What happens when transcript contains special characters, emojis, or non-Latin scripts?
- How does the tool behave with age-restricted content?
- What happens when YouTube API rate limits are hit?
- How does the tool handle malformed or corrupted transcript data?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST accept YouTube video URLs in standard formats (youtube.com/watch?v=, youtu.be/, etc.)
- **FR-002**: System MUST extract available transcripts from YouTube videos using official APIs or methods
- **FR-003**: System MUST support plain text and Markdown output formats
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide file output option with user-specified filenames
- **FR-005**: System MUST display clear progress indicators during transcript extraction
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle multiple languages when available [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auto-detect primary language or require user specification?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide helpful error messages for common failure scenarios
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate YouTube URLs before attempting extraction
- **FR-009**: System MUST follow constitutional requirement for cross-platform compatibility
- **FR-010**: System MUST implement robust error handling for network timeouts and API failures

### Key Entities

- **Video**: Represents a YouTube video with URL, title, duration, available transcript languages
- **Transcript**: Contains text content, timestamps (if available), language code, and formatting metadata  
- **OutputFormat**: Defines how transcript content should be formatted (plain text, Markdown)
- **CliOptions**: Configuration object containing user preferences (format, output file, language, etc.)

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can successfully extract transcripts from 95% of public YouTube videos with available transcripts
